# Reproducible Microbiome Analysis

Demo scripts to help learn a few reproducibility techniques combining R, markdown, Pandoc, and LaTeX. The results, I have found, are better statistical programming skills, cleaner analysis, transparent reproducibility, and a richer understanding of your own data. 

Data used here are from a subset of the 16S Illumina MiSeq dataset used in Meadow et al. (2014, [Microbiome 2:7](http://www.microbiomejournal.com/content/2/1/7)). That manuscript explored the bacterial communities present on indoor classroom surfaces, and reported that the way we interact with surfaces predicts the bacteria present on those surfaces. 

Folders: 

* `reportRmd`: scripts, data, and output of a demo analysis report from the `knitr` package in R. These outputs are used to produce further output in the `reportPandoc` folder. 
* `reportPandoc	`: scripts and templates for using Pandoc to convert Rmarkdown analysis documents to LaTeX and MS Word format. 
* `manuscriptRmd`: scripts, data, and output of a demo manuscript from the `knitr` package in R. These outputs are used to produce further output in the `manuscriptPandoc` folder. 
* `manuscriptPandoc	`: scripts and templates for using Pandoc to convert Rmarkdown manuscript documents to LaTeX and MS Word format.
